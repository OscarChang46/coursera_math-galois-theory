\begin{que} % Question 1
Let $F(x)/G(x) \in K(X)$ be a rational function over a field $K$. Show that the extension $K(F/G)/K(X)$ is algebraic and compute its degree.
\end{que}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{que} % Question 2
Let $L/K$ be an algebraic extension and $\phi: L \to L$ a $K$-algebra homomorphism. Show that $\phi$ is always an isomorphism. Give a counterexample when $L/K$ is not algebraic.
\end{que}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Counterexample when $L/K$ is not algebraic.]

\end{proof}

\begin{que} % Question 3
Let $m, n$ be square-free integers with $m \neq n$ and $m,n \neq 1$. Show that $\Q(\sqrt{m}, \sqrt{n}) = \Q(\sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n})$. Find the degree of $\sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n}$ over $\Q$ and compute its minimal polynomial.
\end{que}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{que} % Question 4
Show that $x^4 + 1$ is reducible modulo every prime $p$ but irreducible over $\Z$. (Hint: $p = 2$ is easy and for $p \neq 2$, consider the group of units in $\F_{p^2}$.)
\end{que}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{que} % Question 5
Show that $x^p - x - 1$ is irreducible over $\F_p$. (Hint: Show it has has no root in $\F_p$ and show that if $\alpha$ is a root in some extension, the nall other roots are of the form $\alpha + a$ for $a \in \F_p$.)
